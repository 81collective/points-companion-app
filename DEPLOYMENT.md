# 🚀 Points Companion App - Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy Options

### 1. Vercel (Recommended) ⚡

Vercel is the optimal choice for Next.js applications:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to production
npx vercel --prod
```

**Or connect your GitHub repo to Vercel:**
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy automatically on every push to main

### 2. Netlify 🌐

```bash
# Build the app
npm run build

# Install Netlify CLI
npm i -g netlify-cli

# Deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy --prod --dir=.next
```

### 3. Railway 🚂

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway link
railway up
```

### 4. Docker 🐳

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t points-companion-app .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 points-companion-app
```

## Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in your deployment platform:

### Required Variables
```env
DATABASE_URL=your_production_database_url
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret_key
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_google_places_api_key
```

### Optional Variables

## Deployment Commands

### Quick Deploy Script
```bash
node deploy.mjs
```

### Manual Steps
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Build production version
npm run build

# 3. Test production build locally
npm run start

# 4. Deploy to your chosen platform
# (see platform-specific instructions above)
```

## Post-Deployment

### Verification Steps
1. ✅ App loads at your domain
2. ✅ Authentication works
3. ✅ API endpoints respond
4. ✅ Location services work
5. ✅ PWA installs correctly
6. ✅ Offline mode functions

### Monitoring
- Check deployment logs for errors
- Monitor performance metrics
- Verify all features work as expected
- Test on different devices/browsers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Fails:**
- Check for TypeScript errors: `npm run lint`
- Verify all dependencies: `npm install`
- Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`

**API Routes Not Working:**
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check API route file naming (route.ts)
- Ensure proper HTTP methods exported

**Performance Issues:**
- Enable compression in your hosting platform
- Verify CDN is working for static assets
- Check bundle analyzer: `npm run analyze`

**PWA Not Installing:**
- Verify manifest.json is accessible
- Check service worker registration
- Ensure HTTPS in production

## Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check the deployment platform's documentation
2. Review build logs for specific errors
3. Verify environment configuration
4. Test locally with production build

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Enable HTTPS in production
- Configure security headers (already included)
- Regularly update dependencies
