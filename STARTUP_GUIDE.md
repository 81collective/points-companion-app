## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Nearby locations not working"
**Possible Causes:**
1. Development server not running
2. Location permissions not granted
3. API keys not configured
4. Database connection issues

**Solutions:**
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Allow location permissions in browser
3. Check environment variables in `.env.local`
4. Test with diagnosis script: `node diagnose-issues.mjs`

### Issue 2: "Credit card recommendations not showing"
**Possible Causes:**
1. No business selected
2. Database has no card data for category
3. API endpoint errors
4. Hook not triggering properly

**Solutions:**
1. Select a business from the nearby list
2. Check database has card_rewards data
3. Open browser dev tools to check for API errors
4. Test API directly: `node test-fixes.mjs`

### Issue 3: "Design looks the same as before"
**Causes & Solutions:**
1. **Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **CSS Not Loading**: Check if globals.css is imported in layout.tsx
3. **Development Server**: Restart with `npm run dev`
4. **Component Classes**: Verify components use new CSS classes

## Database Requirements

### Required Tables:
1. **card_rewards**: Credit card data with categories and rewards rates

## Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
# Check if dependencies are installed
npm ls

# Restart development server
npm run dev

# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run build

# Test APIs without frontend
node diagnose-issues.mjs

# Comprehensive feature test
node test-fixes.mjs
```

## Next Steps if Issues Persist

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Verify Network Tab**: Check if API calls are failing
3. **Test Location Permissions**: Ensure browser allows location access
4. **Database Verification**: Run diagnosis script to verify data availability
5. **Hard Refresh**: Clear browser cache and reload

The application should now have a modern, enhanced design with working nearby business discovery and credit card recommendations. All components use the new CSS classes for consistent styling and improved user experience.
