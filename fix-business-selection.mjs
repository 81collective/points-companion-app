console.log('🔧 Business Selection & Recommendations Fix');
console.log('==========================================\n');

console.log('🐛 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:');
console.log('When selecting a nearby business, credit card recommendations were not updating.');
console.log('Root cause: Missing businessId and businessName parameters in recommendation API calls.\n');

console.log('✅ FIXES IMPLEMENTED:');
console.log('1. Updated useCardRecommendations hook to accept businessId and businessName');
console.log('2. Updated cardService to pass businessId and businessName to API');
console.log('3. Updated recommendations API to handle businessName as fallback');
console.log('4. Updated NearbyBusinesses component to pass selected business data');

console.log('\n🔄 NEW FLOW:');
console.log('1. User clicks on a nearby business');
console.log('2. setSelectedBusiness() updates selectedBusiness state');
console.log('3. useCardRecommendations hook triggers with:');
console.log('   - category: business.category');
console.log('   - businessId: business.id');
console.log('   - businessName: business.name');
console.log('   - latitude/longitude: user location');
console.log('4. API receives businessName and creates temporary business object');
console.log('5. Brand detection logic runs on business.name');
console.log('6. Recommendations update with brand-specific cards (hotel/airline)');

console.log('\n🎯 WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN NOW:');
console.log('✅ Click "Marriott Downtown" → See Marriott Bonvoy cards recommended');
console.log('✅ Click "United Airlines Terminal" → See United Explorer cards recommended');
console.log('✅ Click "Local Restaurant" → See dining category cards recommended');
console.log('✅ Recommendations section updates immediately when business is selected');

console.log('\n🧪 TEST SCENARIOS:');
console.log('1. Select a hotel business → Should see hotel brand cards');
console.log('2. Select an airline business → Should see airline brand cards');
console.log('3. Select a restaurant → Should see dining category cards');
console.log('4. Switch between businesses → Recommendations should update each time');

console.log('\n🚀 READY TO TEST!');
console.log('The business selection should now properly trigger updated credit card recommendations.');
